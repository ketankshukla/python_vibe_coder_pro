I'm a Python Developer based in San Diego, CA, with a strong foundation in building robust web applications and data processing systems. My journey in software development has been marked by a hands-on approach to learning and problem-solving, which has led me to develop practical skills in full-stack development and data engineering.

My technical journey began with Python, where I quickly fell in love with its clean syntax and powerful libraries. Over time, I've built a diverse portfolio of projects that showcase my ability to create functional solutions. I've worked on everything from weather applications and ETL pipelines to blog platforms and data analysis tools, each project teaching me valuable lessons about software architecture and user experience.

What sets me apart is my focus on practical solutions. I believe in building systems that work well and are maintainable, rather than over-engineering solutions. This approach has helped me deliver projects that meet real-world needs while being efficient and reliable.

My technical stack includes:
- Python for backend development and data processing
- Next.js and React for modern web interfaces
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- SQL and NoSQL databases for data storage
- Git for version control and collaboration

I'm passionate about continuous learning and enjoy tackling new challenges. Whether it's optimizing a data pipeline or improving a user interface, I approach every task with a problem-solving mindset and a commitment to delivering quality work.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, or enjoying the outdoors in San Diego. I believe that the best solutions come from combining technical knowledge with real-world experience, and I strive to bring that perspective to every project I work on.
